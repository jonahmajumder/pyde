# pyde: A Python Development Environment

PyDE is an IDE built in Python, to easily run and debug Python code. Graphical interface is made with Qt, and the command-based interface is built on the pexpect package.

This application is largely inspired by the Matlab IDE, adapted to Python.

Planned Improvements:
- [ ] Line by line debugging
- [ ] Preferences that remain across sessions
- [ ] Code timing
